// This is a list of user UIDs that have admin access.
//
// HOW TO ADD YOURSELF AS AN ADMIN:
// 1. Sign up for your application with an email and password.
// 2. Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
// 3. Navigate to your project -> Authentication -> Users tab.
// 4. Find the account you just created and copy its "User UID".
// 5. Paste the UID into the array below, replacing the placeholder.
//
// IMPORTANT: For security, you might want to disable sign-ups after
// creating your admin account. You can do this in the Firebase Console
// under Authentication -> Sign-in method.
export const ADMIN_UIDS = ['REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ADMIN_FIREBASE_UID'];
